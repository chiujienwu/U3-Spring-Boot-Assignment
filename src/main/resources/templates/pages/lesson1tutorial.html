                    <p>There is no such thing as a Bitcoin. The virtual currency is nothing more than a public ledger
                        system, called the blockchain, that keeps track of an ever-expanding list of addresses, and how
                        many units of bitcoin are at those addresses.</p>
                    <p>If you own Bitcoin, what you actually own is the private cryptographic key to unlock a specific
                        address. The private key looks like a long string of numbers and letters. You may choose to
                        store your key, or keys if you have multiple addresses, in a number of places including a paper
                        printout, a metal coin, a hard drive, an online service, or a tattoo on your body.</p>
                    <p>All methods can be protected with various levels of security, but all methods are vulnerable to
                        theft since the robbery simply depends on gaining access to the string. “I recommend creating physical
                        paper wallets using an Arch Linux boot which has never been online,” says Marak Squires, an
                        early Bitcoin adopter who is developing a secure Bitcoin bank. “Unfortunately, this is not an option
                        for most people. For the average user there are no good options right now to securely store
                        cryptocurrencies.”</p>
                    <p>The most lucrative attacks are carried out on online services that store the private keys for a
                        large number of users, as Sheep Marketplace did. It seems these attacks are often carried out by
                        insiders who don’t have to do much hacking at all. Just copy the database of private keys and you can
                        gain control of the bitcoins at all those addresses. You, the thief, can now spend those bitcoins
                        whenever you want, as long as the owner doesn’t move them first.</p>
